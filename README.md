**Emotion Recognition with OpenCV***


**Overview**
This project implements emotion recognition using OpenCV and deep learning. It detects facial expressions in real-time video streams and classifies them into different emotion categories.

**Features**
Real-time emotion detection
Supports multiple emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised)
Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)
Easy to integrate with other applications
